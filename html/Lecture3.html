          This time around, I trust myself
        Please everybody else but myself
        All else fails, I was myself
        Out done fear, out done myself
        This year, you better one yourself (and I'm trippin' and fallin')
        Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
        Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shot
        But a mask won't hide who you are inside
        Look around, the realities carved in the lies
        Wipe my ego, dodge my pride (and I'm trippin' and fallin')
        Look myself in the mirror
        Amityville, I ain't seen nothin' scarier
        I fought like a pit bull terrier, blood I shed could fill up aquariums
        Tell my angels, "Carry 'em" (and I'm trippin' and fallin')
        Every emotion been deprived
        Even my strong points couldn't survive
        If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg
