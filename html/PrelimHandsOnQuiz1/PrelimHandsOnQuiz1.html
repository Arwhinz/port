        <h1>Crossroad Sangandaan</h1>
        <h2>Quezon City</h2>
        
        <p>Crossroad Park Tandang Sora is a bustling shopping mall located at 610 Tandang Sora Avenue, Sangandaan, Novaliches, 
        Quezon City, Philippines. This 13,000-square-meter development offers a variety of retail stores, dining options, and \
        essential services, catering to the diverse needs of the local community.</p>
        
        <p>Crossroad Tandang Sora was established in 2015 as a community hub designed to bring convenience and accessibility to the 
        residents of Sangandaan, Quezon City. The shopping complex was developed and is currently owned by the Fortless Land, a local 
        real estate company focused on commercial and transport-oriented spaces.</p>
        
        <p>My teenage years were spent here, doing absolutely nothing and everything simultaneously. When 2017 started, I struggled to make 
        friends, but I managed to find six of them. Over time, we grew, and so did our circle. After class, my friends and I used to hang out 
        here, playing Uno and talking about how we would stay in touch after senior high school since all of us would be going to different 
        schools. Those same people I spent my junior and senior high school years with are the best people I have ever met. College is tough, 
        but I always imagine what it would be like if I were with them, laughing through problems every day. I would give anything to go back to 
        the past for at least a day to this exact place with them and once again enjoy their company one last time.
